# vercel-flask-starter
## A starter template for deploying Python Flask web server to Vercel. Such a nice way!

### Step 1. make sure creating an "index.py" to hold the app's entrypoint. Included the 'app = Flask()' variable.
### Step 2. make sure the 'vercel.json' and its content is created.
### Step 3. Hoola! Let's deploy them in a second!
